## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: User Authentication and Book Display (~ 1 day)
I will write my own authentication system for creating users and logging in according to the best practices taught at App Academy. I will scrape some seed data to work with from the Gutenberg Project, and display them in HTML format on login. By the end of this phase, I will be sure that I can retrieve content and deploy to Heroku.
